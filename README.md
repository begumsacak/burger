# Burger App
Burger app is a restaurant app built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devoured button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
